# Covid-Trends-Ppt

For these trends we really focused on 3 metrics; overall impressions by platform, increase/decrease in new user ids, and change in select rate from right before the start of quarantine to current date. Select interact rate is defined as sum(people who select interact after watching)/sum(people who select watch). I used sql to pull raw data and then brought raw data in pivot tables/pivot tables for easy data visualization.
